 * For example: the home page ("/") and the about page ("/about").
 *
 * ðŸ”’ Protected Routes:
 * All other routes that are not defined as public will require the user to be logged in.
 * If a user tries to access a protected route without being authenticated,
 * they will be redirected to the sign-in page.
